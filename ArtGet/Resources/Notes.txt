TO DO:
Support for more audio files
More in depth progress reporting, maybe an "advanced" diagnostic section that could be hidden
MORE Error checking is needed:
	Look into the folder attributes/file numbers to have program notice if they chose the wrong folder
Intuitive output of failed albums
Better cancellation
Clean up code

Possible new multithreading model:
	Use anywhere from 8-32 threads for getting the artwork URLs
	Use ONLY 1 or 2 for applying artwork

for v1.0 - test on Operating Systems

v0.1:
	Set up basic algorithm
	Set up basic GUI
	Threaded operation into background and put together progress bars
	Support for mp3 only
	Simple crawling only, not thorough - added option to GUI anyway (disabled)
	Very basic error catching in place

v0.1.1:
	Split browse and crawl with two BackgroundWorkers and add button enabling/disabling
	Added multithreading:
		8 Threads
		Each thread both parses and adds album art
		Added base64 encoding to have wild card art names in temporary .jpgs
	Reverted restrictive progress struct with fixed stepping
	Added simple failure report at end of operation
	Added deleting of temporary art files at end of operation

v0.2
	Undid thread grouping to make continuous feed through 8 threads
	Added M4A Support
	Added corrupted audio output/detection
	Fixed cancel button on folder browsing
	Updated progress reporting while crawling
v0.2.1
	Rearranged gui, removed thorough option
	Added support for cancelling crawling
	fixed small glitch in reporting how many albums have been crawled by using separate int for albums finished
	Made program aware of blank artists/albums
v0.3
	Added .NET version watching with custom Window
	Tweaked layout (cancel button)
	Cleaned up Song.cs and Tools.cs
	Began messing with thorough crawl
		Divide image into 9 subsections (3x3)
		Get every tenth pixel, take average
		Get list of common art
		Pick highest reso version


Trashed thorough crawl
added really in depth error checking
revising .NET stuff
Added tooltip on labels and diabled horizontal scroll bar
Fixed aspect ratio errors with integer divison
Redid layout with small images and responsivity

Did some testing on other computers
Starting to clean up code
Added support for browse cancellation, and fixed up button enabling/disabling
